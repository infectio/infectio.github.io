## About

Viruses spread between cells, tissues and organisms by cell-free and cell-cell mechanisms depending on the cell types, viruses or phase of infection cycle. The mode of viral transmission has a large impact on disease development and the outcome of anti-viral therapies. The transmission mode may be addressed in tissue culture systems using live-cell imaging. Yet even in those simplified systems the complex mechanisms of viral transmission are often convoluted and difficult to distinguish on the phenotypic level. We have previously showed for human adenovirus that characterization of virus transmission mode may further be addressed by constructing a computational model of the bio-physical processes yielding the observed phenotypes. Here we present a generalized software framework capable of simulating transmission phenotypes in tissue culture of virtually any virus. We argue that this software framework may assist researchers in designing novel strategies of perturbing viral transmission.

## **Current Status:** Beta Testing in Progress

The current status of our software *beta*. As soon as all the testing will be complete the software will be available on GitHub for forking, cloning and download under GPLv3 open source license from [github.com/infectio](http://github.com/infectio). Stay tuned.
However, if you would like a preview of the developers version of the Plaque 2.0 software please contact [Artur Yakimovich](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Artur_Yakimovich)  on Research Gate.
